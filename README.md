My introduction to 30 Days of Code originally came from HackerRank. After finding the series on YouTube I decided to complete the series on YouTube independent of HackerRank. This code is far from perfect as I am still learning. Even with the excellent instruction from @BlondieBytes, I found that improvising or find errors on my own was a little challenging. If you find something that is out of order or could be done better, please let me know.
